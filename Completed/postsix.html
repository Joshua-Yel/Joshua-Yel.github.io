                    When someone is diagnosed with a mental health disorder such as depression or anxiety, firstline treatments usually include psychological therapies and medication. What’s not always discussed are the changeable lifestyle factors that influence our mental health.<br><br>
                    Even those who don’t have a mental health condition may still be looking for ways to further improve their mood, reduce stress, and manage their day-to-day mental health.It can be empowering to make positive life changes. While time restrictions and financial limitations may affect some people’s ability to make such changes, we all have the ability to make small meaningful changes.<br><br>
                </p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><h3> Improve your diet and start moving</h3></li><br>
                    <p>
                        Whole foods such as leafy green vegetables, legumes, whole grains, lean red meat, and seafood, provide nutrients that are important for optimal brain function. These foods contain magnesium, folate, zinc, and essential fatty acids. <br><br>
                        Foods rich in polyphenols, such as berries, tea, dark chocolate, wine, and certain herbs, also play an important role in brain function. In terms of exercise, many types of fitness activities are potentially beneficial – from swimming to jogging to lifting weights or playing sports. Even just getting the body moving by taking a brisk walk or doing active housework is a positive step. <br><br>                  
                        Activities that also involve social interaction and exposure to nature can potentially increase mental well-being even further. General exercise guidelines recommend getting at least 30 minutes of moderate activity on most days during the week (about 150 minutes total over the week). But even short bouts of activity can provide an immediate elevation of mood.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <li><h3> Reduce your vices</h3></li><br>
                    <p>
                        Managing problem drinking or substance misuse is an obvious health recommendation. People with alcohol and drug problems have a greater likelihood than average of having a mental illness and have far poorer health outcomes.<br><br>
                        Some research has shown that a little alcohol consumption (in particular wine) may have beneficial effects on preventing depression. Other recent data, however, has revealed that light alcohol consumption does not provide any beneficial effects on brain function.<br><br>
                        Stopping smoking is also an important step, as nicotine-addicted people are constantly at the mercy of a withdrawal-craving cycle, which profoundly affects mood. It may take time to address the initial symptoms of stopping nicotine, but the brain chemistry will adapt in time.<br>
                        Quitting smoking is associated with better mood and reduced anxiety.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <li><h3> Prioritise rest and sleep</h3></li><br>
                    <p>
                        Sleep hygiene techniques aim to improve sleep quality and help treat insomnia. They include adjusting caffeine use, limiting exposure to the bed (regulating your sleep time and having a limited time to sleep), and making sure you get up at a similar time in the morning.<br><br>
                        Some people are genetically wired towards being more of a morning or evening person, so we need to ideally have some flexibility in this regard (especially with work schedules).<br><br>
                        It’s also important not to force sleep – if you can’t get to sleep within around 20 minutes, it may be best to get up and focus the mind on an activity (with minimal light and stimulation) until you feel tired.<br><br>
                        The other mainstay of better sleep is to reduce exposure to light – especially blue light from laptops and smartphones – prior to sleep. This will increase the secretion of melatonin, which helps you get to sleep.<br><br>
                        Getting enough time for relaxation and leisure activities is important for regulating stress. Hobbies can also enhance mental health, particularly if they involve physical activity.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <li><h3> Get a dose of nature</h3></li><br>
                        <p>
                            When the sun is shining, many of us seem to feel happier. Adequate exposure to sunshine helps levels of the mood-maintaining chemical serotonin. It also boosts vitamin D levels, which also has an effect on mental health, and helps at the appropriate time to regulate our sleep-wake cycle.<br><br>
                            The benefits of sun exposure need to be balanced with the risk of skin cancer, so take into account the recommendations for sun exposure based on the time of day/year and your skin color. You might also consider limiting your exposure to environmental toxins, chemicals, and pollutants,  including “noise” pollution, and cutting down on your mobile phone, computer and TV use if they’re excessive.<br><br>
                            An antidote to this can be simply spending time in nature. Studies show time in the wilderness can improve self-esteem and mood. In some parts of Asia, spending time in a forest (known as forest bathing) is considered a mental health prescription.<br><br>
                            A natural extension of spending time in flora is also the positive effect that animals have on us. Research suggests having a pet has many positive effects, and animal-assisted therapy (with horses, cats, dogs, and even dolphins) may also boost feelings of well-being.<br><br>
                        </p>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Sometimes it may feel like you don't deserve to rest, especially when you feel like you haven't been getting anything done. But there is no point in going down this self destructive line of reasoning. We need to learn to not be so hard on ourselves and know that our value as people is not exclusively tied to our work. At the end of the day you are more than just what you produce. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Maybe a good step in finding this value is finding a hobby that is meaningful to you. Rest is not purely directionless and sometimes you would want to work towards something meaningful to you, even though it is not exactly related to your job or course. We need to recognize that our work can be alienating, and alienation can stem from a lack of purpose and agency in our work. Getting a hobby that is meaningful to you can bring back a lot of that agency.
