                    Stress is no stranger to us. We overwork ourselves, never make time for rest, and the next thing you know we're experiencing burnout after doing piles and piles of work. Of course, it's inevitable once the sweet sensation of rest is ignored. Given this, why is taking a break important?
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Take studying for example, avoiding rest would mean too much information could cause an overload in your brain. But taking a rest means your brain could easily digest all the information you've gathered. Study has indeed shown that the accumulation of stress can lead to psychological damage towards your brain and physical towards your body.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sometimes it may feel like you don't deserve to rest, especially when you feel like you haven't been getting anything done. But there is no point in going down this self destructive line of reasoning. We need to learn to not be so hard on ourselves and know that our value as people is not exclusively tied to our work. At the end of the day you are more than just what you produce. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Maybe a good step in finding this value is finding a hobby that is meaningful to you. Rest is not purely directionless and sometimes you would want to work towards something meaningful to you, even though it is not exactly related to your job or course. We need to recognize that our work can be alienating, and alienation can stem from a lack of purpose and agency in our work. Getting a hobby that is meaningful to you can bring back a lot of that agency.
